Hello!

Turns out that there is no Hearthstone API. There are a few unnoficial API's that give access to the cards in json format, it's all fine and all, but I don't know if there is much that I can do with it.

Wait!!! What is an API you say?! I could go into detail here, but lets just think of it as a web service that allows anyone to get information from inside the database of the game, thats why there are lots of games like Dota2 and League of Legends that has tons of sites showing hero-picks, game results, best equipements, win-rate, etc. Those games have api's that allows those sites to access the game database directly.

Because of it, the access to the "real" data in Hearthstone is rare, there are very few people with access to it, and mortals like you and myself can only see the processed result.

Some deck-trackers, such as Track-O-Bot, send your data to a database in the web so you can access it your browser, but, there is a catch, the "API-key" for this service, which is a special personal password, can be donated alongside your username to projects like Data-Reaper from [viciousSyndicate](http://www.vicioussyndicate.com/ "Good site, really!"), with access to enough peoples data from Track-O-Bot they can generate very detailed reports based on real data, extract REAL information from the metagame and provide insights with knowledge of reality, not just "good guesses", but informed decisions. And in todays world this is priceless! Actually, this is usually darn expensive!

Not being able to access directly the data that Data-Reaper has at Vicious Syndicate is not a great problem, since he is doing a very good job at working with those data, I consider him as a colleague doing "half" of the job, leaving me with time to do the other half. Yes, it would be good to have access to it, and yes, I will start a project to have access to it and more importantly to give full access to this data to whoever wants.

## What is left for me to do?

My dear Watson, thats quite elementary, I will explain the information in a way interested players may understand.

Also, I will look not just at this information, but I will also read the people feelings toward decks and cards, changes, patches and nerfs, with robots I'll look into twitter, reddit and some forums. All open source because I am lazy and if someone want to help I am grateful.

## Where I'll post my findings?
Good question, I'll probably post something on my youtube channel, and I think that maybe here I post something, maybe a page with all the reports I have done? Dunno, possibly.
